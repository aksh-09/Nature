<h3 class="text-center mt-4">ABOUT US</h3>
<p class="text-center pt-4 ms-4 me-4 mb-5">Nature's Paradise germinated in 2014 from a promise to make ‘green and
  healthy’ a click away for all Indians
  Having plants in our homes or in our offices doesn’t just look good, it also boosts our mood, makes us more
  productive, and cleans the air around us by absorbing toxins
  Most of us being urban dwellers spending their days in apartments with limited access to parks and ecological
  reserves, have no way of feeling close to nature and experiencing the benefits of being around plants.
